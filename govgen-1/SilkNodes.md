1. The name of your validator

Silk Nodes

2. Why you want to become a validator for GovGen and AtomOne

We are believe that our values and ideas are aligned with yours. In the past, we've expressed concerns about the trajectory of the CosmosHub, particularly regarding the perceived lack of value brought by ICS for stakers and validators. This sentiment was a contributing factor to our decision to vote against Prop 848.

3. Brief history/ Intro to your validator

At Silk Nodes, we take pride in being positioned as one of the most decentralized validator operations within the Cosmos Ecosystem. Distinguishing ourselves, we maintain full ownership and self-hosting of our hardware, strategically distributed across two geographically distinct locations â€” one in Ireland and another in the US. Unlike several validators who merely assert their commitment to "decentralization" while relying on common hosting providers that dominate a substantial portion of the network, Silk Nodes deliberately adopts a more decentralized approach. This philosophy aligns with our conviction that true blockchain decentralization necessitates a proactive commitment to diversification.

In addition to our dedication to decentralization, we offer an extensive array of services. These encompass custom Discord bot integrations, both public and premium node infrastructure services, routine node snapshots, and comprehensive guides tailored for emerging validators, among other offerings. Our commitment extends beyond mere validation, embodying a holistic approach to support and empower participants within the blockchain ecosystem.
